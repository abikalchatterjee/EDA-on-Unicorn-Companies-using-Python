# EDA-on-Unicorn-Companies-using-Python
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Unicorn_Companies.csv dataset, which contains information about private companies valued over $1 billion as of March 2022. The primary focus of this analysis is twofold: examining the valuation of companies by industry and understanding the time it takes for companies to reach unicorn status.

The dataset provides valuable details about unicorn companies, including their valuation, funding, founding year, industry, and the year they became a unicorn. Through this analysis, we aim to explore key questions, such as which industries dominate in terms of company valuations, and how long it takes for companies across various sectors to reach a $1 billion valuation.

The key objectives of this EDA include:

Valuation by Industry: Analyzing how different industries compare in terms of company valuations and funding.

Time to Become a Unicorn: Identifying trends and patterns in the time it takes for companies to achieve a $1 billion valuation based on their founding year and the year they became a unicorn.

Investor Insights: Providing insights into which industries and sectors have the highest growth potential, helping investors make informed decisions on where to invest for high returns.

The analysis utilizes Python and libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, and Matplotlib for data visualization. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we gain insights into the growth patterns of unicorn companies, the industries leading the way, and the factors influencing their success.

This EDA provides valuable information for entrepreneurs, investors, and market analysts looking to understand the global landscape of unicorn companies and the factors that contribute to their rapid rise. It also offers investors insights into where to focus their capital for future high-growth opportunities.
